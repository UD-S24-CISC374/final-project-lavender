# Schedulsine

## Elevator Pitch

An Overcooked like cooking game, but for learning OS scheduling algorithms. Different algorithms are represented as different dishes, and you have to put together their algorithm steps (ingredients) to create the final dish. It’s timed, with your score being determined by how many dishes you successfully create.

## Influences (Brief)

- *Overcooked/Overcooked 2*:
  - Medium: Games
  - Explanation: This game series is an influence mainly through its gameplay, scoring system. Players act as chefs and must prepare food very quickly. To prevent orders from being failed, typically the players must complete the orders in order of when they pop up on screen. Gameplay features include throwing, placing, and picking up objects such as food items, cookware, and plates. Players must move around items and complete orders in a timely manner in order to get the highest score, which is in the form of money and tips from customers.
- *Papa's Pizzeria*:
  - Medium: Games
  - Explanation: Mainly influenced by the scoring system & theme. A restaurant management game where you have to take orders, bake, and serve the best pizzas to the customers; essentially just taking the “taking orders” part of the game for our own game. Its high score system is also useful.
- *Influence #3*:
  - Medium: *(Television, Games, Literature, Movies, etc.)*
  - Explanation: *In one paragraph or less, explain why this is an influence.*

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

As stated previously, the main gameplay loop is very similar to the Overcooked series.

- The steps of a scheduling algorithm are the different steps of making a dish. Different steps lead to different end results (different algorithms).
- *Recipes*: Different recipes require players to follow different steps and utilize different ingredients
- *Scoring*: Different algorithms/dishes give different points, failing to complete a dish/algo. takes away points. Completing dishes quickly gives more points*
- *Timing*: There will exist a timer during gameplay. Goal would be to encourage players to try out and complete as many different algorithms(dishes) before time runs out!*
- *Campaign*: As players progress through the game, levels become more difficult and complex.

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

* Operating Systems.
* Logic & Algorithms.

## Target Audiences

* Semi-novice programmers, just learning about Operating Systems.
* Students from late middle-school to the college level.

## Target Contexts

* Ideally, used as supplementary material/practice in a course teaching the aforementioned learning domains.
	* Formal learning contexts could include a syllabus set day of playing this game in a middle school or high school level class. The instructor can facilitate discussion about the game and can require students to write notes after each game is played, and have an assessment based on what they are learning from the subject.
	* Informal learning contexts could include students or colleagues playing the game together, unrestricted by the classroom or studies. This can be hobby-based learning by having the game be downloadable or browser based.
* May not be entirely adequate as an "in-class" activity though.

## Learning Objectives

- *Scheduling Algorithms*: By the end of gameplay, students will be able to write out the steps of an OS scheduling algorithm.
- *Identify Algorithms*: By the end of gameplay, students will be able to know the difference between the different types of scheduling algorithms.
- *Combining Algorithms*: By the end of gameplay, students will be able to combine algorithms together in an efficient manner.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

- Prior to the game, players need to have a basic idea of how OS scheduling works.
- Prior to the game, players need to know what an operating system is.

## Assessment Measures

A short pre-test and matching post-test should be designed to assess student learning.

# What sets this project apart?

*Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.*

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

Mostly designed for single-player, but could handle up to four. Requires usage of keyboard, mouse is optional. Keyboard for basic movement and actions of a character, mouse to help with menu navigation.

## Player Modes

- *Single-Player*: Complete all levels to win. Try and obtain the highest possible score for each level.
- *Multi-Player*: Same as single player; however, you probably would be able to pick any level instead of going through them sequentially.

# Gameplay Objectives

- Complete orders quickly and correctly:
    - Description: Players must fully prepare and cook kitchen orders in a given amount of time without failing the order or making mistakes.
    - Alignment: The dishes represent job processes, completing a dish represents completing a process. Dishes are completed in the style of a scheduling algorithm.
- Advance to the next level:
    - Description: After completing all kitchen orders in a given amount of time, the player can advance to the next level, with more complex scheduling needs.
    - Alignment: Successful completion of a single level means mastery of that specific level's scheduling needs/requirements.
- Complete all levels:
    - Description: Get through all the levels to win the game.
    - Alignment: Indicates basic mastery of OS scheduling algorithms, and how best to use them.

# Procedures/Actions

Main control scheme would be keyboard and mouse.
- WASD: Basic movement.
- LEFT CLICK: Pick up/Place down object (ingredients, dishes, etc ).
- RIGHT CLICK: Interact with objects (stoves, refrigerators, etc.)

# Rules

*What resources are available to the player that they make use of?  How does this affect gameplay? How are these resources finite?*

# Objects/Entities

- There is the player character, a chef.
- There is the kitchen, which acts as the play area and stores “workstations” that house ingredients or perform certain actions on food..
  - Refrigerator, oven, food crates, plating area, etc.
- There is a pop-up on the screen, showing the current orders.

## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure to make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aesthetics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*
