# Blurb

Schedulesine: a fast-paced, cooking simulator that also teaches you basic sorting algorithms! Complete dishes in the correct order, based on the current algorithm strategy you have, and try to complete as many dishes as you can! The more dishes you complete in the given amount of time, the more money you make!

# Basic Instructions

Use the mouse and the LMB to navigate through the menus. Once in-game, use WASD for movement and the LMB to pick-up/interact with a variety of objects (note: your mouse does NOT need to be hovering over the object in-game to interact with it, the player character needs to be).
